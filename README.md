# Battleship-Game
# Instructions:
Place the ships on the board and make someone search for them.
To find all of the ships, you need to hit 17 cells but you can only miss 19 times.
Every time you hit the ship, you will see a red dot on the correct spot, otherwise it will mark a red "X" symbol.
Check on the side box for the remaining ships to find and number of missed shots you made.
